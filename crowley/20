KWAN: Manifesting; contemplating; see
thou be sincere, pure, just, with dignity.


Thoughtless and boyish: little shalt thou see!
Peep from thy door - a woman's modesty.
Consider thine whole course insistently.
State's weal resolved, seek aid of majesty.
Consider thy life's course, lest action err,
And criticise thy soul's true character.
