SHIH HO: Unite by gnawing; here success
comes by the proper use of legal stress.


Nip crime in the bud; lop toes, put feet in stocks;
Else - flesh and nose must next be bitten through.
Quick, or dried flesh gives double work to do!
Gnaw, gnaw, fake pledges ere the gate unlocks.
Gnaw: gold rewards precaution firm and true.
Or, last, the Gangue - the ears cut off, fate mocks.
