KUNG FU: Supreme sincerity; thy wish fulfilled.
For this moves even pigs and fish.

Trust thou thyself, repose in thine own sphere.
But welcome and reciprocate good cheer.
A mate involves vicissitudes that vary;
He travels fast who travels solitary!
Men are most loyal to men most sincere;
But failure's for sky-soaring chanticleer!
