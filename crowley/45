ZHUI: Collection; to the shrine repair
and sacrifice the greatest victories there!


Alone, art helpless; call thy right ally;
With him, even small prayers earn heaven's swift reply.
Baffled, yet struggling, thou shalt cease to sigh.
Success excuses boldness; recollect
then to be firm in virtue and correct!
Weep for thy loneliness - but still aim high!
