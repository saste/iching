LI: Is the treading of the path that's right!
Step on the tiger's tail; he will not bite.


Follow the path of thine accustomed right;
Level and easy walks the anchorite.
Learn vanity, the brave's bluff, to flee!
Tread on the tiger's tail; he will not bite.
Firm, resolute - yet perilous thy plight;
Examine well, the augury of the flight.
