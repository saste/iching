CHEN: Fire! Beware, but smile with mein divine!
Let nothing scare thee into spilling wine!

Here's trouble; watch thy ways, but drink thy wine!
Take lofty ground; the tide will ebb and flow.
Distraught? May danger teach thee low to go!
Fight fire with fire, or sink in mud supine!
Troubles mean profits for the men who know.
Caution! Foresee the action of the foe!
