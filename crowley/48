ZING: Well; the common fountain of increase.
If kept with care, its virtues never cease.


Muddy or dried, what use? Beware decay.
Leaky: for shame! The worker is disgraced.
Clear, but unused; how senseless is the waste!
Well laid and lined, how noble the display.
Come drink the water - cold, pellucid - chaste.
Here to the brim it bubbles - go thy way!
