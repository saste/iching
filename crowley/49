KO: Change; men doubt until their dullness sees
the change wisdom can foretell with ease.

At first; though art bound with strips of yellow hide.
Wait then a little, time's a friend to thee.
Haste may wreck all; discuss thy plans untried.
First gain men's confidence; then saddle and ride!
Swift as a tiger - with the Yi for a guide!
Confirm thy change with firm sincerity.
