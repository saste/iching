KIEN: Gradual progress: be thy right firm carriage
suggestive of a lady's decent marriage.

Wild geese approach the shore - with care they fly!
They reach the rocks - and pasture joyfully.
Dry plains they cross - it needs a vigorous wing!
They reach the trees, and rest; but not too high.
At last they gain the goal of traveling;
See on broad heights their feathers glittering.
