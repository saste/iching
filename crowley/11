THAI: The due order of things; we see, in sum,
good fortune, small things gone, and great things come.


Pull up one stalk; and others follow it.
Seek patience, self reliance, love and wit.
Though all things change, rejoice; for that is writ.
Call friends to help thee, they may bring thee through.
Remember what Ti Yi thought right and true.
The city's fallen; there's little thou canst do.
