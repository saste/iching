KWAI: Cutting off; displeasure; front thy foe;
but show reluctance due in acting so.


Lay well thy plans before the march begins.
Seek loyal friends and have no fear of gins.
Fight on alone; persistant courage wins!
Defeated, acquiesce - smiles conquer grins.
Uproot small men like purslane - tan their skins;
Cut off is he - and evil his end be!
