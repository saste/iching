HSIEN: Mutual influence; good fortune bless
Man's firm correctness with the tide, success.


Would'st walk? To move thy toes alone is a flaw;
But calves? 'Twere surely better to withdraw.
Thigh's too? Cling close to leaders? Thou wilt
rue it.
Insited plans? Only thy friends pursue it.
But shrug thy shoulders! God shall gladly view it.
The wag not thy toungue, nor drop thy jaw!
