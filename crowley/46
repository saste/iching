SHANG: The ascent; go seek the lofty one!
And in the south give worship to the sun!


Make thyself welcome with the great; aim high!
Small gifts are sweetened by sincere good will.
But empty cities - art thou bold to fill?
The king rewards thy true sincerity;
Ascend the stairs with proper dignity.
Firm right maintain, though blind the silent sky!
