ZIN: To advance - when thou hast won folk ease,
thy lord shall give thee gifts and dignities.


Firm, patient and great hearted, wait thy day!
Move with regret - the royal mother's way!
Confidence thus begotten - why delay?
Advance by stealth; the marmot guide thee yet;
Woo not success; the games's the game to play.
Use power with caution or beware regret!
