KHWEI: All's disunion, mother of distress;
But in small matters there may be success.


Lost steeds return; bad men may yet take thy way;
Thy lord may chance to meet thee - in the byway.
Baffled and punished? Bide time's amnesty.
Alone and disunion? Friends on highway
Joined with thy minister thy course is free.
Pigs? Ghosts? Foes? Nay! Go forward on the skyway.
