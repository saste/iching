SUI: Follow after; but in following checked
by being firm, unwavering and correct.


Changing pursuit, seek friends beyond thy gate.
Should one leave old, and follow a young boy?
Wiselier leave youth, and age's wit employ.
Adherents hurt; make sure thy way is straight.
Follow all excellence with eager gait.
The sincere king may sacrifice with joy.
