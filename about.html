<h2>About this website</h2>

<p>
  This website was done as an assignment for the course in "Web
  development", kept at the University of Cagliari by Fabio
  Sorrentino, for the <a href="http://informatica.unica.it/">Bachelor
  Degree Course</a> in Computer Science.<br>
</p>

<p>
  I had to learn and use a lot of cool stuff in order to get the site
  working, in particular I used:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> for what regards the
  server-side processing.
</li>

<li><a href="http://api.jquery.com/">JQuery</a> - the most coolest
  Javascript library ever written, and
  the <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/form">JQuery form</a> plugin.
<li>

<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as server-side
  database server.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">The One True
  Editor</a> for all the typing/editing operations.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The idea of the website comes from
  the <a href="http://www.ichingonline.net/">Iching Online</a>
  website, which I consider pretty good from the design point of view,
  and this implementation basically borns as a barebone port of the
  functionality provided by that site, but without the ads!
</p>

<p>That was a painful process to learn how to tame and bind together
  all that stuff, but I had some fun and possibly I learnt something
  along the way.
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
