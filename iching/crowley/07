7 THE SZE HEXAGRAM

Yoni of Moon

SZE: Armies; all depends upon the sage,
His ripe experience, and his wisdom's age.


Mark well the rules of martial strategy.
Chief of the host, thy king confers the post.
Divided counsel - inefficiency!
Retreat is not an error if need be.
Seek and destroy bad faith and mutiny!
But find good men for posts of dignity.
