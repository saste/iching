55 THE FANG HEXAGRAM

Fire of Sun

FANG: Large, abundant; now care's night is done.
Shed forth thy glory as the noonday sun.

First meet thy mate, then multiply thy force.
Be humbly loyal in obscurity;
Let not its accidents disturb thy course.
Mated in darkness - men! 'Tis fortune's source.
Then, call the clansmen of ability!
But pride and insolence slay majesty.
