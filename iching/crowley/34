34 THE TA KWANG HEXAGRAM

Fire of Lingam

TA KWANG: Great strength. Be firm and self-reliant;
But - tyrannous to use it like a giant!


Plant firm thy feet, but dare not yet to move!
Thy firm correctness exercise and prove.
Fences entangle rams who blindly shove.
Strength fails to force some gates that yield to love.
Thine purpose gained, relax - nor tax thine heart so;
Once tangled, the best chance is - to know thou art so!
