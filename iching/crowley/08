PI: Union. First examine, art thou right?
Then the restless join thee; woe the laggard's plight.


Sincerity of union is the key;
From inward mind comes forth true unity.
Unite not with unworth's iniquity!
There's one beyond thyself that yearns for thee.
Base well thy tower upon the people's power.
Thy first step missed? Disaster shalt thou see.
