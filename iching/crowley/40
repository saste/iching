KIEH: Loosing; if all's won, return and rest.
If partial gain, quick action will be best.


Begin to loosen - Straight and clear the way.
Rid fields of foxes; fill the golden quiver.
Beggars on horseback tempt the brigand's play.
Stand not to oppose the friends come to deliver.
Remove all wrong; then all men own thy sway.
The prince the falcon on the wall shall slay.
