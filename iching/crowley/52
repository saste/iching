KAN: Earth; keep silence like thy spine! See none
about thee! Thus the silk of wisdom's spun.

Plant firm thy feet; repose be now thy law.
Thy legs - 'twere ill to advance them or withdraw.
If loins move, the heart's liable to riot.
Keep still thy body's fidgets, Johnny raw,
and, for the love of heaven hold thy jaw!
Fortune attends who persevere in quiet.
