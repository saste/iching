19 THE LIN HEXAGRAM

Yoni of Water

LIN: Great; here's progress and success to firm
correctness; but -  more trouble at the term!


Now with thy comrade firmly force the pace!
Advance with him - alliance wins the race.
Be cautious, or advance may lead thee astray.
Go forward only in the noblest way.
Great rulers need great wisdom every day.
Honest, magnanimous, woo fortune's ray.
