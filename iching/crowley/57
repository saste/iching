57 THE SUN HEXAGRAM

Air of Air

SUN: Wood, wind; mark their subtly suave persistance!
Elastic ease, the line of least resistance.

Infirm of purpose, learn the soldier's way.
Ask humbly of the gods to guide thy course!
Violent excess of struggle breeds remorse.
Wide forethoughts and shrewd tactics pledge thee prey.
With steady, easy strokes apply thy force.
Fear, indecision, sap the last resource.
