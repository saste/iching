56 THE LU HEXAGRAM

Sun of Earth

LU: Stranger, Firm right conduct may unravel
most of the tangles incident to travel.

Mean men by menial toil increase their woe;
Well lodged, served, monied men more easy go.
His house on fire, his servants fled, 'ware danger.
Though rich, armed, rested, still set caution ranger!
Good manners, self effacement with the throw;
while arrogance and violence hurt the stranger.
