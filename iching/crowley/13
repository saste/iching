13 THE THUNG ZAN HEXAGRAM

Lingam of Sun

THUNG ZAN: Men's union! Everywhere the clan!
Cross then the stream, thou firm, superior man!


Here first the master rises from his gate.
Well should he flee the cares of family!
Concealed, but watchful, the right born await!
Be ready to attack, but tempt not fate.
Through tears to laughter, victory crowns thy state.
Even in the suburbs men proclaim thee great.
