6 THE SUNG HEXAGRAM

Lingam of Moon

SUNG: Strife: be cautious; seek not the extreme.
Seek help from friends, and do not cross the stream.


Perpetuate not strife, though slandered thou.
O'ermatched, retire, concealment be thy friend!
Maintain thy place, but claim no glory now.
O'ermatched, the study of heaven's law perpend.
Now with great fortune on thy side contend!
Victorious, the fruit's bitter in the end.
