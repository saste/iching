HSIAO KWO: Exceeding in small things I've heard
to soar too high is risky for the bird.

The issue's evil when birds soar too high;
The wisest course is humble loyalty.
Without precautions, enemies assail;
But adaptation and sound care prevail.
Birds in a cave - sure marks for archer's eye!
Ambition, in bad times, is lunacy.

HSIAO KWO: Excessive trifles; but beware
in great things not to trust thyself to air.

Winged though thou be, soar not too rashly high!
Let not self seeking out run loyalty!
Men be incaution ask their foes to assail;
Tact and adroitness helps one to prevail.
At easiest mark, let thine arrows fly!
Uncurbed ambition courts calamity.
