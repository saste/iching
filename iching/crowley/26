26 THE TA KHU HEXAGRAM

Earth of Lingam

TA KHU: The great accumulation; quit
thy private virtue when state needeth it.


Peril; move not, but look within thine heart.
Then, with due care, be ready for the start.
Now, with good horse, well trained, play hard thy part!
Block even the young bull's horns! He's safer so.
Castrate the boar - its teeth will gently show.
Then rule the stars - good fortune aid thine art!
