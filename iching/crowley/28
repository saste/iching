28 THE TA KWO HEXAGRAM

Water of Air

TA KWO: A weakened beam is under stress.
To move in any manner spells success.

Place mats for things set down; then faults are few.
Dead willow shoots; old man young wife well wooing.
The beam is weak; fate's busy with the brewing!
The beam curves up - loyalty did the glueing.
Dead willow flowers; old wife young men pursuing!
Bold wader, thine head's wet - but thou wast true!
