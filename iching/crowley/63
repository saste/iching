63 THE KI ZI HEXAGRAM

Moon of Sun

KI ZI: Perfected work. Perfection borders
close to the frontiers of new disorders.

Maintain success; be history's lessons heeded!
Alarmed, be not distracted or unsteady;
Put to each enterprise the full force needed!
To stop the first leak, vigilant and ready.
Small works wrought wisely are most surely speeded!
Rash violence drowns in dark disaster's eddy.
