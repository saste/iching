3 THE CHUN HEXAGRAM

Moon of Fire

CHUN; Firm, correct; great progress this evinces
and vantage from appointing feudal princes.


Hard mere advance, maintain thy place correct.
Distress, retreat; fear not, a friend is nigh.
Lost in the wood, seek not a deer to espy.
Retreating, seek thy mate; with him, aim high.
Dispense rich favors as thy friends expect.
Thine house bolt; bleed tears of agony!
