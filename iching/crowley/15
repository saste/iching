15 THE CHIEN HEXAGRAM

Yoni of Earth

CHIEN: Humility; this yeast's to baking.
A man may win in every undertaking.


Increase humilities; so clears the way!
Once recognized, who is there to gainsay?
Acknowledged merit will success inherit.
Grow thou more truly humble every day.
Thus all thy neighbors in thy cause array.
Use force - but only on the proper prey!
