4 THE MANG HEXAGRAM

Earth of Moon

MANG: Inexperience; let them see the sage.
One gains his smile; twice will excite his rage.


Correct him once to free; twice? Let him go!
Treat fools and women kindly, they've their uses.
Wed not loose women, only that they know.
Chains bind the ignorant, and sorrows flow.
Yet - the great fool! Simplicity's good glow!
Protect the ignorant from all abuses!
