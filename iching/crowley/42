42 THE YI HEXAGRAM

Air of Fire

YI: Increase; now's no time to sit and shiver;
but to move on, even to cross the river.


Success excuses boldness; face thy fate!
Good omens and true virtue joined, essay!
Ill leads to well, for him who leads the way;
Even the capital remove he may.
Let all men share in thine approved estate!
By soul's disorders realms disintegrate.
