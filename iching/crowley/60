60 THE KIEH HEXAGRAM

Moon of Water

KIEH: Regulations: measured steps, but fear
impermanent results if too severe!

There is a time when wisdom urges rest.
Another when the bird should leave his nest.
Observe no rules? Lament; the blame's to thee.
Attend them quietly - success flows free.
Enact right laws - be tactful with decree,
for men are vexed when harshly pressed.

KIEH: Regulations. Who can do without them?
But not too many, lest men come to flout them!

Quit not thine house to meddle with the state;
But set good order still within thy gate.
Thou mayest lament if thou should'st disobey.
But keep the law and go thy peaceful way.
Enact thy laws - suave, tactful, moderate;
But vex not men with harshness overweigh!
