41 THE SUN HEXAGRAM

Earth of Water

SUN: Diminution; be sincere; the price
is not the measure of the sacrifice.


Leave business to help friends, but yet be wary!
Guard against action; of the cash be chary!
Three walk, one's gone; one walks, and meets a two.
By friendship one finds woes becoming few.
Here's tortoise shells from the chosen few.
Prudent though kind well served by friends o'dignitary.
