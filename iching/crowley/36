36 THE MING HEXAGRAM

Yoni of Sun

MING: Intelligence sore hurt; reflect
on the position rigidly correct.


Hurt? Droop thy wings and fast, while critics leaguer.
A horse may save one wounded in the thigh.
Thy great foe taken, be thou not over eager!
Escape from night by mind's propriety.
Think how the court of Ki met destiny.
At last earth swallows him that trod the sky.
