16 THE YU HEXAGRAM

Fire of Yoni

YU: Satisfaction spreads through all thy coasts.
Appoint thy princes, and send forth thy hosts!


Boast not of pleasure! There lurks overthrow.
Be firm, with foresight all thy soul aglow.
Presume not; understand - what came may go!
Shed happiness, call friends to share success!
Make not a habit; joy's as dull as woe.
Oh! Think more deeply; change is wisdom's throw!
