54 THE KWEI MEI HEXAGRAM

Fire of Water

KWEI MEI: To give first younger daughters - ill course.
Don't start with the carriage in front of the horse.

Go to it, ye cripples! I'll hold your crutches.
Blind of one eye? Be as chaste as a dutchess!
Now, younger sisters there's scrubbing to do!
Better postpone matrimonial clutches!
Think of Ti-Yi and his sisters anew!
No meat on the chops, and no beans in the stew.
