47 THE KHWAN HEXAGRAM

Water of Moon

KHWAN: Straitened and distressed; the great man acts.
But rhetoric is far removed from facts.


Bare buttocks - tree stump - valley - hopes decay.
Embarrassed king, be quiet and sincere!
Rocks, thorns - come home, and find thy wife astray.
Even with friends the course is hard to steer.
Rebellion? Honesty has nought to fear.
Bound? On the brink? Repent and take thy way!
