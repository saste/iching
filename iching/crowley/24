24 THE FU HEXAGRAM

Yoni of Fire

FU: Coming back; thou'rt free to come and go.
Friends help; now move with confidence aglow


Correct small blunders - look for lucky wonders!
Hast erred? Return and take the proper way.
Return, return; and go no more astray!
Return though all thy comrades say thee nay.
Nobly return - the master of thy day!
But error piled on error - deuce to pay!
