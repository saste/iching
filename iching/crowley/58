58 THE TUI HEXAGRAM

Water of Water

TUI: Still waters may run deep and free;
Mistake not slackness for philosophy!

Appease thyself, harmonious in thy sphere!
Single thy will, most utterly sincere!
Turn not aside when siren pleasures woo!
Search thyself well to make thy purpose clear.
Too trustful customers may buy too dear.
'Tis pleasant to be captain of thy crew!
