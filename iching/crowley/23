23 THE PO HEXAGRAM

Earth of Yoni

PO: Falling; overturning; when things quake
to agitate them more is a mistake.


Injure the couch's legs, soon all will go;
Injure its frame, soon total overthrow.
Destroy, when need is - will not wisdom show?
The couch destroyed, its occupant hath woe.
Be loyal, help thy followers; all's aglow.
That'll bear thee brave; the small man digs his grave.
