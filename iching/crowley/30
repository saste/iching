30 THE LI HEXAGRAM

Sun of Sun

LI: Sun; attachment. Be thy way docile
as well as firm - then see good fortune smile.


Confused at start? Let reverence befriend.
Here's fortune - rightly placed and clothed in yellow.
Accept thy ills with cheer or worse attend.
Abruptness - fie! Thus fire and death descend.
Luck comes to aid thee, melancholy fellow!
In victory be just - a noble end.
