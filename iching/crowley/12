PHI: All's disorder in the organum.
We see the great gone, and the little come.


Again one stalk pulled brings the others too.
Patience, obedience, fitness, build anew.
Shame hide thy purpose from thy own right view!
Act rightly; comrades come to love thee and wonder.
Restoring all things, murmur, We may blunder.
The darkness passes; light breaks forth from under.
