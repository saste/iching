18 THE KU HEXAGRAM

Earth of Air

KU: Service. Thou mayst cross the stream no doubt,
if thou have fully thought thy purpose out.


Good son, repair thy sire's infirmity;
Be gentle with thy mother's frailty, Son.
Yea, clear thy father's troubles, every one.
Restrain thy course; view them indulgently.
Thus gain the praise of thine utility.
Do what thou wilt, thyself, a slave to none!
