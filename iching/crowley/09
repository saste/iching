9 THE HSIAO CHU HEXAGRAM

Air of Lingam

HSIAO CHU: Shows small restraint. Hence quick success.
But clouds indeed, we ask rain's happiness.


Strayed - Come thou back and follow thy own plan!
By true attraction mete thy starry span!
Anger in wedlock or a car en panne!
Bloodshed and woe sincerity bids go.
Sincerity: Here's help from all the clan.
Who wins too much may lose! Repose, O man!
