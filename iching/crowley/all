THE I CHING
A new translation of the
Book of Changes
by The Master Therion

INTRODUCTION

The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form. Its structure
is cognate with that of the Qabalah; the actual apparatus is simple,
and five minutes is sufficient to obtain a fairly detailed answer to
any but the most obscure questions.  To Mega Therion

THE TAO

1. TAO concentrateth itself upon Kether as a point.

2. TAO directeth itself within Chokmah and becometh the Male Force. He is called YANG, and is symbolized by a Solid Line.

3. TAO expandeth in Binah and becometh the Female Force. She is called YIN, and is symbolized by a Broken Line.

4. These three: TAO, YANG and YIN, bring forth heaven and earth, and all contained therein.
THE APPARATUS

0. TAO is the source of the Yi King, as of all.

1. Thou shalt obtain 6 Chinese coins. Five shall be of one metal and the sixth of another. One side ye shall call Yang, and the other Yin (Heads and Tails).

2. These coins should be kept in a wrapped black cloth, and no other should lay his hand upon them. For they swell with thine aura when used with sincerity and repetition.

3. Hast no coins? Six sticks will serve. Paint one side solid and the other broken. One of the six is especial; It should be made unique by painting one end on both sides. Care for thine sticks as though they were coins.
THE METHOD

4. When a situation ariseth in thy mind, and you wouldst seek an oracle, do thus: Go and take out thine coins or sticks.

5. Face thou East; and make clear thy mind, so that no thoughts shall intrude.

6. Call upon what god ye will; filling thyself with pure light, and raising thine mind to a fixed image of the situation into which you inquire.

7. Then, gently toss thy sticks or coins toward the East; they wilst fall into a certain pattern which thou wilt arrange into an Hexagram - the unit of Divination of this book: Yi King.
THE HEXAGRAM

8. An Hexagram is made up of six lines; each line being Yang or Yin. The especial stick or coin is called "The Moving Line."

9. Each line of the Hexagram is numbered: The line nearest thyself is number One; whilst the farthest away is number Six.
AN EXAMPLE

10. Thou hast concentrated upon thy situation, and thine sticks have fallen thus:

Line 6 - YANG (a solid line)
Line 5 - YANG (a solid line)
Line 4 - Yang (a solid line)

Line 3 - YANG (a solid line)
Line 2 - YIN (a broken line)
Line 1 - YIN (a broken line)

( - The moving line is in line 2)

11. The Hexagram will look like this:

----------
----------
----------
----------
----  ----
----  ----

12. Take notice that the Hexagram is divided into two Trigrams: An upper Trigram and a lower Trigram.
INTERPRETATION

13. Taking thine key, which is in this book: thou wilst find the upper Trigram along the top of the squares. Next, find the lower Trigram at the left of the chart.

14. Follow thee the Trigrams into the center of the Key - Behold the number 33.

15. Then, thou shalt read the Thirty-third Hexagram in this Book: Yi King.

16. The first two lines refer to the Hexagram as a whole, shewing thee the direction of the matter.

17. Next, appeareth a six-line poem. The first line of this poem
pertaineth to the line number One in the Hexagram. The last line of
the poem is for number Six (the one farthest from thy-self).

18. The Moving Line (in this case number Two) is the specific line which pertains to thy situation: Thine answer from the TAO.

19. If thou dost not understand, and are bewildered by doubts and
questions concerning the Forces of this Divination: Thou mayest read
in "Magick" where the Master Therion hath made discourse upon the
subject by his understanding of the TAO.

ZING: Well; the common fountain of increase.
If kept with care, its virtues never cease.


Muddy or dried, what use? Beware decay.

Wait then a little, time's a friend to thee.

First gain men's confidence; then saddle and ride!

CHEN: Fire! Beware, but smile with mein divine!
Let nothing scare thee into spilling wine!

Here's trouble; watch thy ways, but drink thy wine!
Take lofty ground; the tide will ebb and flow.
Distraught? May danger teach thee low to go!
Fight fire with fire, or sink in mud supine!
Troubles mean profits for the men who know.
Caution! Foresee the action of the foe!

KAN: Earth; keep silence like thy spine! See none
about thee! Thus the silk of wisdom's spun.

Plant firm thy feet; repose be now thy law.
Thy legs - 'twere ill to advance them or withdraw.
If loins move, the heart's liable to riot.
Keep still thy body's fidgets, Johnny raw,
and, for the love of heaven hold thy jaw!
Fortune attends who persevere in quiet.

KIEN: Gradual progress: be thy right firm carriage
suggestive of a lady's decent marriage.

Wild geese approach the shore - with care they fly!
They reach the rocks - and pasture joyfully.
Dry plains they cross - it needs a vigorous wing!
They reach the trees, and rest; but not too high.
At last they gain the goal of traveling;
See on broad heights their feathers glittering.

Don't start with the carriage in front of the horse.

Go to it, ye cripples! I'll hold your crutches.
Blind of one eye? Be as chaste as a dutchess!
Now, younger sisters there's scrubbing to do!
Better postpone matrimonial clutches!
Think of Ti-Yi and his sisters anew!
No meat on the chops, and no beans in the stew.

Then, call the clansmen of ability!
But pride and insolence slay majesty.

most of the tangles incident to travel.

Mean men by menial toil increase their woe;
Well lodged, served, monied men more easy go.
His house on fire, his servants fled, 'ware danger.

Good manners, self effacement with the throw;
while arrogance and violence hurt the stranger.

With steady, easy strokes apply thy force.

'Tis pleasant to be captain of thy crew!

HWAN: Dissipation; in the world of fools.
The kingly man stands firm, divides and rules.

One needs a horse in this world's mob-mellay;
One needs a refuge, a secure shrewd plan.
We must have knocks, nor mind them, in the fray.
Scatter the mob, then pick the choice array.
Command the mob, and fill their bellies, man!
Good end forgets how badly it began.

impermanent results if too severe!

There is a time when wisdom urges rest.
Another when the bird should leave his nest.
Observe no rules? Lament; the blame's to thee.
Attend them quietly - success flows free.
Enact right laws - be tactful with decree,
for men are vexed when harshly pressed.

KIEH: Regulations. Who can do without them?
But not too many, lest men come to flout them!

Quit not thine house to meddle with the state;
But set good order still within thy gate.
Thou mayest lament if thou should'st disobey.
But keep the law and go thy peaceful way.
Enact thy laws - suave, tactful, moderate;
But vex not men with harshness overweigh!

to soar too high is risky for the bird.

The issue's evil when birds soar too high;
The wisest course is humble loyalty.
Without precautions, enemies assail;
But adaptation and sound care prevail.
Birds in a cave - sure marks for archer's eye!
Ambition, in bad times, is lunacy.

HSIAO KWO: Excessive trifles; but beware
in great things not to trust thyself to air.

Winged though thou be, soar not too rashly high!
Let not self seeking out run loyalty!
Men be incaution ask their foes to assail;
Tact and adroitness helps one to prevail.
At easiest mark, let thine arrows fly!
Uncurbed ambition courts calamity.

Small works wrought wisely are most surely speeded!
Rash violence drowns in dark disaster's eddy.

Retire in the face of overwhelming odds.
To the world's mote thine own eye's beam apply not!
War patient through persistent periods!
So win to fortune, fame and flame that die not;
masterful, modest, feast thou with the gods.
