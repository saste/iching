44 THE KAU HEXAGRAM

Lingam of Air

KAU: Suddenly encountering -- behold
a woman -- do not wed her? who is bold.


Restrain weak folly - or woo melancholy!
Here's fish - but ask not fishy folk to dine!
Defeated, yes; but not at meat with swine!
No fish - because thou hast mixed with thieves, in fine
conceal thy virtues - cellars ripen wine!
But hermits lose things human for divine.
