37 THE KIA ZAN HEXAGRAM

Air of Sun

KIA ZAN: The household: This right rule's its base!
The wife be firm, correct, in her own place.


First, proper law's the necessary thing.
House keeper, keep the house with modesty!
Be stern for idleness and chattering.
Thus fortune helps enrich the family.
All share the luck of the high handed king.
Sincere, majestic, the end's glittering.
