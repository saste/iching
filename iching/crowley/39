KIEN: Incompetence and lameness; time
for the great man to aid thee in the climb.


Advance adds trouble; stillness aids thee now.
Keep struggling with no self to mar thy vow.
Advance not; seek again thine ancient clan!
Advance not; be with those united thou.
Struggle! Friends come to prosecute thy plan.
Advance not! Wait for aid from the great man!
