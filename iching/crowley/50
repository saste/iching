50 THE TING HEXAGRAM

Sun of Air

TING: Cauldron; firm its auspice we may guess,
realization, progress, and success.

Upset the foul pots! thy whore earns mother fee.
Before thou eat set guards about thy table!
Frowns failure if thou be not equitable.
Then shame on thee; thy case is pitiable.
Gold ornaments men's firm sincerity.
And rings of jade attest him honourable!
