64 THE WEI ZI HEXAGRAM

Sun of Moon

WEI ZI: Work ruined! Ah so nearly crossed
the stream! Step slackly once, and all is lost!

Is thy force equal to thy task? else try not!
Retire in the face of overwhelming odds.
To the world's mote thine own eye's beam apply not!
War patient through persistent periods!
So win to fortune, fame and flame that die not;
masterful, modest, feast thou with the gods.
