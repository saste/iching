2 THE KHWAN HEXAGRAM

Yoni of Yoni

KHWAN: Great, originating, right and fair,
piercing and helpful, firm as in the mare.
If the true man should move, his feet will stray;
for him to follow is his proper way.


Hoar-frost! The strong one cometh by and by.
Straight, square and great, advantage springs to aye.
Maintain, but boast not virtue's majesty.
Here is a sack made safe by skillful tie.
Behold the yellow skirt; ill fortune fly.
Dragons at war: Gold, blood and porphyry.


(Correct and firm the conduct, thou shalt spy
good fortune from the sky.)
