HSU: Patience; be sincere; success will gleam
Firmness brings fortune, thou mayest cross the stream.


Wait, constant, in the border of the land.
Wait, slandered, by the mountain torrents sand.
Ah! Shun its mud, or mischief is at hand.
Still wait, midst blood. Forth from cavern hie!
Still wait, at festival - Oh firmly stand.
Three guests come helping; greet them courteously.
