HANG: By persistance are great empires built.
There is no law beyond do what thou wilt,


Lust of result mars will in every way;
But steadfast purpose spans the vast abysm.
Maintain thy virtue - heed not criticism!
Seek not reward; thy work be its own chris,
Passion love wins, where active loses, fray;
And violent efforts end in swift decay.
