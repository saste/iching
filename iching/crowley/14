14 THE TA YU HEXAGRAM

Sun of Lingam

TA YU: Great havings; wealth's a sorceress,
within whose cauldron bubbles up succes.


Steer clear of wrong, envision clear thy road.
Lo! The great wagon with its golden load!
Great prince to heaven's son his duty hath showed.
But guard resources as his jewel a toad.
Sincerity is matched bu majesty.
In all ways heaven's blessing hath overflowed!
