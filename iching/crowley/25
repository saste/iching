WU WANG: Sincerity and prudence; splendid
if in these matters thou hast not offended.


Free from all insincerity, press on!
Good going, if thou reap with never a plough!
Yet - innocence oft bears guilt's branded brow.
Firmness, correctness; these bid woe begone.
The good man sick? He needs no doctor-don.
Time's come when silence's book is best to con.
