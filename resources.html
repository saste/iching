<h2>I-Ching resources</h2>

<p>
  There are a lot of resources on I-Ching, as it is an ancient and
  classic textbook and permeates the Eastern culture.
</p>

<p>For a starting point
  check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">the wikipedia
  article</a>.
</p>

<p>The most important source of knowledge of I-Ching in the Western
  culture is the first and still more known and appreciated translation,
  is the translation by Richard Wilhelm's from Chinese to German,
  which was then translated to English by Cary F. Baynes. The book
  reference for the interested book is:
  <quote>
    Richard Wilhelm's and Cary F. Baynes translation "I Ching: Or, Book of
    Changes" [3rd. ed., Bollingen Series XIX, (Princeton NJ: Princeton
    University Press, 1967, 1st ed. 1950)].

  You can find a version of the
  book <a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>There are not many more translations available, another one which I
  included in this website is due to the most famous occultist and
  freak of all the times, Mister Alistair Crowley, which wrote a
  translation tagged as "Liber 216" under the title of Master Therion,
  which was the name which Crowley was using as O.T.O. minister.
  I don't know if Crowley was able to translate the text or if he was
  helped by others, that would be interesting to know.
